Jeremy Grebner and Nick Olive
OPFS

Running this make file with create a directory named /ofps
and copy some executable files to it.  Make sure you have
permissions to do this!

Libraries used:
libexif, libsqlite3, fuse


To build:

sudo make share

To clean

sudo make clean

Running as sudo with the share target allows all users to access
the mounted file system.  The filesystem will be mounted in the
same directory as the opfs executable in the mnt/ directory.


Usage:

Copy pictures to any directory in the mounted file system.

Browse the directories to view pictures in different sorting
systems.

Enter the Search/ folder, and then type 'cd term', where
'term' is part of a filename that you wish to search for.
All files with the substring 'term' will be listed in this directory.

To encrypt a file you originally copied into the file system:
mv original.jpg original+private.jpg

To decrypt an encrypted file that you originally copied into the
system:
mv orignal+private.jpg original.jpg

All other expected commands work, such as mv, cp, rm, as well as
opening an editing in any image editor.

See the design document for a more detailed explanation of features.
